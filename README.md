Imagine an app that connects people worldwide for language practice through random calls. Picture this: you select a language, get matched with someone, and start chatting to improve your skills. I'm currently developing this project, and the frontend is already shaping up nicely. The backend is in progress.

Exciting news: I'm planning to add a video calling feature soon! Yes, you heard it right. Soon, you'll not only chat but also see and talk to others. It's like bringing the in-person language exchange experience online.

If you're passionate about languages, tech, or just intrigued by the idea, let's collaborate! Share your thoughts, or join the journey. We're all about learning and growing together.
